**Welcome to YOUR ZBot assembly Doc**

<br />

TLDR: We are building a robot!

<br />

There will be a lot of screwing parts together, so get good ergonomic supplies and some good podcasts ready. Order is important in a few steps, as is attention to detail as called out!

<br />

Read through before diving in!

<br />

Rotor Attachments refer to attaching to the two metal plates which go on either side of the motor shaft.
