Import KOS into your project:

```python Python
import pykos
```

If you have a operational robot, you can now record your first actions.

To make it easier to get started with KOS skills, we've written a Python package to record and playback your robot's actions.

Just run

```Text bash
pip install skillit
```

and import anything you need!
