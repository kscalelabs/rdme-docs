## Tracks

### Track 1: Zeroth Bot Humanoid Olympics

#### Marathon

Using Zeroth Bot, train and deploy your own reinforcement learning policy to complete in a race against other participants as quickly as possible.

#### Weight Lifting

Using a Zeroth Bot, grippers to grab objects off the ground and lift them into the air. Re-racking your weights is always appreciated.

#### Dancing

Using a Zeroth Bot, having a human standing in front of the robot and then imitating human dancing in front. (Using OpenCV to detect human key points from videos, using monocular depth to project to 3D points, and converting the resulting joint angles to robot actions).

#### Debating

Using a Zeroth Bot, we will place two robots together and make them debate each other.

### Track 2: Capabilities and Ecosystem Expansion

​Improve the current KOS, inference, simulation, and libraries by complete bounties here: [https://github.com/orgs/kscalelabs/projects/16/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/kscalelabs/projects/16/views/1).
