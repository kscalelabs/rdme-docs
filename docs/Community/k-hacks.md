K-Scale Labs also reserves the right to delay delivery of, or revoke, an announced prize in the event that plagiarism or similar dishonest conduct is credibly alleged and proven by one Hackathon participant against another.

### 9. Non-Disparagement

Participants in the Hackathon agree not to disparage K-Scale Labs, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, volunteers, sponsors, or partners in any written or oral statement. This does not prohibit the winner from providing truthful information in response to any legal process, including but not limited to a subpoena or court order; provided, however, that unless absolutely infeasible you will immediately notify K-Scale Labs of your receipt of any instrument of legal process, and under no circumstances any later than forty-eight (48) hours of its receipt, to permit K-Scale Labs to evaluate whether it is required to oppose disclosure of the sought-after information.

### 10. Media Coordination

* Hackathon winners agree to submit any proposed media (e.g., blog posts) about their award or project to K-Scale Labs for its records.
* Hackathon winners agree that at K-Scale Labs’ discretion they may be featured in interviews or promotional content created by K-Scale Labs, including as published on K-Scale Labs’ website and other media platforms.

### 11. Hold Harmless and Indemnification

* To the extent that you utilize any tools, application programming interfaces ("API’s"), or any other intellectual property which is owned by a third party outside the scope of any license which the third party may require for use of that resource, you agree to hold harmless and indemnify K-Scale Labs in any dispute in which it is alleged by that third party that the Hackathon infringed on its intellectual or other property rights by virtue of your participation in the Hackathon.
* You also agree to indemnify and hold harmless K-Scale Labs, its officers, directors, employees, volunteers, and sponsors from any other claims arising from your participation.

### 12. Failure to Comply with Code of Conduct

* Hackathon participants who are asked to stop any behavior violating any provision in this Code of Conduct are expected to comply immediately with the request. Failure to do so will result in expulsion from the Hackathon.
* Any other violation of this Code of Conduct by a participant or a sponsor may, at the sole discretion of K-Scale Labs, result in your removal from the Hackathon. If the conduct at issue relates to a violation of the rules against unsafe or excessively disruptive behavior, as determined by K-Scale Labs in its sole judgment, it will result in your removal from the Hackathon. If a participant engages in unlawful or harassing conduct (as defined above), K-Scale Labs may take any action deemed appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion of the offender from the Hackathon, or, in serious cases, reporting the conduct to local law enforcement.

Any person asked to leave or ejected from the Hackathon shall not be entitled to any refund of any fees paid by the participant or any third party for the expelled person’s participation in the Hackathon.

If a participant is expelled from the Hackathon for a violation of any provision in this Code of Conduct, they shall not receive any refund of any fees paid to participate in the Hackathon.

By registering to participate in the Hackathon, you acknowledge and agree to each of these terms.

## Additional Event Rules

These are supplemental to the Hackathon Code of Conduct. Your cooperation with each is essential to the smooth operation of the Hackathon and avoid any inconvenience to others.

## Restricted Areas

Certain areas of the house, including but not limited to the upstairs rooms, are off-limits to participants. Please respect these boundaries and do not enter restricted areas.

## Common Areas

Please keep common areas clean and tidy. Dispose of trash in designated bins and be considerate of others by not leaving personal belongings unattended in shared spaces.

## Garage Equipment and Robots

Do not touch any equipment or robots in the garage without permission from the organizers. This rule is in place to protect valuable equipment and ensure safety.

## Noise Levels

While we encourage collaboration, please be mindful of noise levels, especially in areas where people may be working quietly or taking breaks.

## Furniture and Equipment

Use the house’s furniture and equipment responsibly. Do not move furniture or use equipment without permission from the organizers. If you encounter any issues, report them immediately to a staff member.

## Parking

The hackathon organizers are not responsible for parking. Please be sure to park in a manner that is respectful of parking rules and do not block driveways or other cars, which could result in your being towed.

## Reporting Violations of the Code of Conduct

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns about conduct that may violate the Code of Conduct, please contact a member of the hackathon staff immediately.

## Logistics Issues

### Overnight Accommodations

Overnight accommodations are provided on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of K-Scale Labs, depending on availability. If you intend to stay overnight, please let us know ahead of time. You’re welcome to bring your own tent or mattress pad to sleep on as well.

### Parking

Parking is limited, so carpooling is strongly encouraged. Please do not block any neighbors’ driveway under any circumstances! It is illegal and thus can get you towed.

## Challenges

K-Hacks is about building robots. The goal is to accelerate the transition to a world with useful general-purpose robots. You are free to build any new robotics-related project you desire or improve your current existing work. Your project should be related to making a robot do something useful. It is usually easier to start with an existing robot, but you can also produce your own robot design.

## Equipment

* **3D printers:**
  * We use the Bambu Labs X1 Carbon printers. Please contact Ben or JX for assistance setting up the printers.

* **Electronics bench:**
  * Two soldering stations
  * Power supply, multimeter(s), and other relevant equipment

* **Assorted resistors, capacitors, and other components**
